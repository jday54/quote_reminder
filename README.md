To use this template with your own saved urls:
- Copy this code to use as a base
- Have a json file containing urls. Title the file as 'urls.json'
- Adapt the parsing code to account for the format of your json/urls
  - the json file is part of the account data one can download for their Instagram account (explained here: https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920)
- Host your own site using GitHub pages
