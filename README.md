App for picking a random saved quote -- lost things found once again

Online at: https://jday54.github.io/quote_reminder/


To use this template with your own saved urls:
- Copy this code to use as a base
- Have a json file containing urls. Title the file as 'urls.json'
  - The json file I am using is the "saved_collections.json" part of the account data one can download from their Instagram account (explained here: https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920)
- Adapt the parsing code to account for the format of your json/urls
- Host your own site using GitHub pages
- Please credit me by linking to my github :)
